# Explorative Data Analysis of COVID-19 Data in Italy

This project report presents on data analysis and visualization of COVID-19 data of Italy.
<br /> <br />
Italy was, unfortunately, one of the most impacted countries during pandemic, so in this project I try to obtain some insights by visualizing the available data. 

# <sub>Data</sub>
I have used the data that is found in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets /sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-italy . Further information on the data can be found by following the link.
